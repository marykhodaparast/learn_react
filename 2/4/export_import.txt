when we have "export default Person" we should use it as "import Person from ..."
but if we have "export const baseData = 10 " then we should use it as "import {baseData} from ...."

default export => import person from './person'
                  import prs from './person'

named export => import {smth} from './utility'
                import {smth as s} from './utility'
                import * as bundled from './utility'
